# offset_piston_motion
Animation of offset piston motion with Python and Matplotlib

Designed to work on a Raspberry Pi 2

Must have Matplotlib installed to show animation
Must have Numpy installed to complete calculations

input parameters are:
r = 1.0  # crank radius
l = 4.0  # connecting rod length
d = 0.5; # offset distance
rot_num = 6 # number of crank rotations
increment = 0.1 # angle incremement
